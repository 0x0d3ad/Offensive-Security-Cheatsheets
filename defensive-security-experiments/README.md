# \[De\|Of\]fensive Security Experiments

The goal of this project is simple - execute some common/uncommon attacking techniques and:

* understand how the attacks can be performed 
* see what artifacts they leave behind 
* what data sources could be leveraged by the defenders to spot evil
* try out various tools and become more profficient with industry standard tools
* serve as a reminder and reference

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that these are just my personal notes that happen to be accessible publicly. 

Do not take everything or anything for granted nor expect the notes to be very detailed or covering the techniques or the artifacts they leave in full. 

Consider yourself informed!
