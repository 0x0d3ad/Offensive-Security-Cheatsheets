# \[De\|Of\]fensive Security Experiments

The goal of these pages is simple - execute some commong/uncommong attacking techniques. The aim is to understand how the attacks can be performed as well as see what artifacts they leave behind that could be leveraged by the defenders. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that this book serves just as my personal notes that happen to be accessible publicly, so do not take everything for granted nor expect the notes to be fully covering the techniques or the artifacts they leave. Consider yourself informed!
